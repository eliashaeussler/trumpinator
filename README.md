# Trumpinator
Welcome to Trumpinator, the world's best opportunity to deal with Donald Trump's statements! Don't you like what he's talking about on Twitter? No problem, just scream everything you have on your mind inside your computer's mic and it will destroy all the crappy stuff @realdonaldtrump is talking about on Twitter!

## What the hell is that?
*Trumpinator* is our new method to help you get rid of your bad mood in relation to Donald Trump. We all know that he's a unsuitable president and we want him to know our frustration about him. So we decided to develop a tiny program which reads the lastest 200 tweets of @realdonaldtrump and enables you to destroy all of them by screaming inside your computer's mic. You will see, it's freeing! :-)

## How to start
There are both a built macOS application and the open-source Processing code available.

### macOS application
To start the application, you need to
1. Clone or download the project from GitHub
2. Open the file *application/trumpinator.app*

### Processing project
If you want to open the project directly with Processing, you need to
1. Clone or download the project from GitHub
2. Open Processing
3. Open the file *trumpinator.pde*. **Important: All files and folders need to be inside a folder called *trumpinator* (which they are, by default, when you clone the repository)**
4. Press *Run* (or Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)
