# Trumpinator
Welcome to Trumpinator, the world's best opportunity to deal with Donald Trump's statements! Don't you like what he's talking about on Twitter? No problem, just scream everything you have on your mind inside your computer's mic and it will destroy all the crappy stuff @realdonaldtrump is talking about on Twitter!

## What the hell is that?
*Trumpinator* is our new method to help you get rid of your bad mood in relation to Donald Trump. We all know that he's a unsuitable president and we want him to know our frustration about him. So we decided to develop a tiny program which reads the lastest 200 tweets of @realdonaldtrump and enables you to destroy all of them by screaming inside your computer's mic. You will see, it's freeing! :-)
